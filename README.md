The application was saved in GitHub as public because I made it for my own use and retained the copyright. It enabled the creation of an index of names appearing in the application documents https://github.com/zbyszex1/teczka.

Backend made in VisualStudio 2022 as ASP.Net Core 6.0. Debug version runs on Windows 10 and uses MS SQL, Release version is deployed on Linux and uses and MySQL. Both versions use technologies such as dependency injection, Entity Framework, SQL, JWT tokens. The source structure includes directories such as Controllers, Entities, Identity, Migration, Models, Services and Sql.

The integrated frontend based on Angular 14 presents a preview of the tables and views used, and supports a name index creation tool. Appearance being less important, I didn't devote too much attention to it.
